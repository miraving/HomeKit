# HomeKit - smart house

**Home Configuration**

**HMHome**: Say you have a customer with a primary residence and a vacation home. Allowing them to group accessories under a given home will help them organize each area.

**HMRoom**: A home can have several rooms. While this is an optional part of your home, you can provide the customer with a way to better organize the area of their home. If you don’t create any rooms a default room will be provided. All of the new accessories simply attach to it.

**HMAccessory**: These are installed into homes and assigned to rooms. Think of these as your physical automation device, such as a light bulb. Again, if you don’t create any rooms new accessories will be assigned to a a default room.

**HMService**: Accessories provide user-controllable services, like a light. Accessories can have many services. So a fancy light bulb could have a service that turns it on or off and a different service that turns it blue.

**Zones**: These are optional groupings of rooms in a home. For example, grouping all of the lights in your basement under a zone allows you to control the entire zone with a single service.

It’s important to note that meaningful names enable commands like, “Siri, turn on the kitchen lights.” Or if you have a zone downstairs, “Siri, turn off all of the lights downstairs.”
